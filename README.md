# Node85Modules

A small demo of module syntax support in Node.js 8.5.

### Using Node.js 8.5

You're not ready to commit to upgrading to Node.js 8.5 on your system, I get it!

##### On Mac/Linux, install the n module
```
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n --help
sudo n 8.5.0
node --version
```

To revert to your previous version, run
```
sudo n
```
...and select from the list.


##### On Windows, install the nvm app

Go to [https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) 
and download the installer from the
[releases link](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).


### Running the Sample App

Do **not** run ```npm install```

Simply run
```
npm start
```
